# Use a Public API to Create a Gallery

The tenth of twelve projects for the Front End Web Developer Techdegree by [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com)

## Project Instructions

### Use one of the following APIs:
* OMDB
* OpenLibrary
* Steam
* Star Wars
* Spotify
* Pokemon
* Github
* Deck of Cards API

*Itâ€™s okay to use a second API of your choosing, but you must use at least one of the APIs on the list.
Make sure to use endpoints that do not require an API key or the use of OAuth for this project.*

### Grab at least 6 items from the API
For example 6 movies from Open Movie Database, 6 Albums from Spotify.

* Display these 6+ total items in an attractive gallery
* Click a thumbnail to open a lightbox with displaying details of the item
  - Name/title
  - Description
  - Image
  - Other relevant data such as date, categories, price

*See the api-thumbnail-page.png mockup file. You don't need to use photos if the API doesn't provide them. Clickable item titles work as well. Or you can use regular photos (not photos retrieved from the API) as thumbnails.*
